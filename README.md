# NetflixRecommendationSystem
Netflix is a subscription-based streaming platform that allows users to watch movies and TV shows without advertisements. One of the reasons behind the popularity of Netflix is its recommendation system. Its recommendation system recommends movies and TV shows based on the user’s interest.
Here’s How Netflix Recommendation System Works
The recommendation system of Netflix shows you movies and TV shows according to your interests. Netflix has a lot of data because of its user base. Its recommendation system predicts a personalised catalogue for you based on factors like:

your viewing history
the viewing history of other users with similar tastes and preferences as yours
genres, category, description, and more information about the content that you watched in the past
The genre of the content is one of the most valuable factors that helps Netflix recommend more content even to new users. I hope you have understood how Netflix recommends content to its users.
The dataset I am using to build a Netflix recommendation system using Python is downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about all the movies and TV shows on Netflix as of 2021. You can download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/satpreetmakhija/netflix-movies-and-tv-shows-2021.
